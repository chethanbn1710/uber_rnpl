# uber_rnpl â€” Ride Request System with PostgreSQL

Prototype ride-hailing system (Ride Now Pay Later idea-friendly) with a **Client API** and **Server**.
- Client API accepts `user_id`, `source_location`, `destination_location` and forwards to Server.
- Server stores into PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy.
- Test via Postman or curl.
